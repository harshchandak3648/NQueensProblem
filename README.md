# NQueensProblem
# N-Queen Visualiser

- The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
- The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens are under attack. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

- This algorithm is designed using recursion.
- This algorithm is designed using recursion using the concept of Backtracking and this application helps us visualise the problem better and understand how the algorithm works in a better way.
